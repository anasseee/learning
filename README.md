# My learning projects

Here are my project for learning to code.

#Space Invaders

In this project I want to replicate the original "Space Invaders" game, because I think is so simple and competitive, with a good requirement of ability.
So, is a simple game and I like it and for these reasons I've decided to do this project, for learning to become a good Game Developer.
For this game I've decided to use pure Javascript and I want to do the whole game in a unique .js file. Also I want to draw all the objects with code, without using any image file.
